# Web

Web editor built with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)

## Run
```bash
elm reactor
```

Now go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) and start looking at the `examples/` directory. When you edit an Elm file, just refresh the corresponding page in your browser and it will recompile!

To debug Elm-ui you can use `Attribute`
```elm
Element.explain Debug.todo
```
